# POC AI Sketch

## Getting Started
Sketch drawing using [fabric](https://fabricjs.com/) and required *canvas* to be installed. By default, binaries for macOS, Linux and Windows will be downloaded.

#### Override install on vercel
```bash
npm install --build-from-source
```

If you don't have a supported OS or processor architecture, or you use `--build-from-source`, the module will be compiled on your system. This requires several dependencies, including Cairo and Pango.

#### Docker
